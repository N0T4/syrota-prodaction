When I stepped into the role of producer for the first time on our student short film Left Unsaid, I honestly did not know exactly what to expect. I had some organizational skills, a general sense of leadership, and a strong work ethic - but this was my first real experience running a production from the inside. And it was far more intense, rewarding, and eye-opening than I could have imagined.

## Wearing (Too) Many Hats

One of the biggest lessons came from trying to juggle multiple roles - I was not only producing but also working as a camera assistant. At times, I got so caught up in the technical tasks that I lost track of my job as a producer. That was a turning point: I learned the hard way how important it is to maintain the "big picture" view. A producer's job is not about solving one problem - it is about seeing the whole system, keeping all parts moving together, and ensuring the vision stays on track.

## Challenges Are Part of the Process

No production is without its hiccups. We faced technical issues, communication breakdowns, and schedule disruptions - all of which forced us to adapt on the fly. But instead of letting those moments define us, the team pulled together. We reshaped the project, did reshoots, rethought scenes - and ended up with a film that was stronger and more emotionally impactful than what we first imagined.

This experience reminded me that challenges are not signs of failure - they are invitations to improve. Being a producer does not mean avoiding problems; it means facing them calmly and creatively, while holding the team together.

## Leadership = Clarity + Humanity

One of the most meaningful parts of this journey was learning how to lead with both professionalism and empathy. At one point, I had to make a tough call about crew roles, and the situation required clear boundaries - but also compassion. That moment taught me that a producer must know when to be firm, but never stop being human.

## The Producer Mindset

By the end of the project, I realized that being a producer is more than just planning and logistics - it is about protecting the vision of the project, while making sure everyone involved is supported and equipped to do their best work. It is problem-solving, decision-making, adapting, and guiding - all at once.

## Final Thoughts

Left Unsaid was not perfect - but it was real. It came from a place of growth, experimentation, collaboration, and ambition. I am proud of what we created, and even more proud of what I discovered along the way:
- That I can lead under pressure.
- That I can bring people together.
- And that producing is something I not only enjoy - but deeply want to pursue.

This was just the beginning, but it gave me a foundation I will build on for every project to come.

    title: 'Sound Is a Feeling: What Working with Audio Taught Me About Storytelling',

When we think about filmmaking, we often focus on what we see. The frame, the light, the actors, the edit. But my experience working as a sound recordist, especially on documentary projects, taught me something I did not fully expect:

Sound is not just heard — it is felt.

It is the pulse of a rave crowd, the echo of a quiet hallway, the breath someone takes before they say something important. Sound shapes our emotional perception of a scene, often more than visuals do — and once I started working with audio, I never saw film the same way again.

## Capturing Real Moments

Working on a documentary about techno and rave culture, I was tasked with capturing raw, real-time sound in chaotic and unpredictable environments. No second takes. No perfectly placed mics. Just being present, anticipating energy shifts, and staying tuned in.

From the pounding rhythm of a live set to the ambient sounds of the street before and after the party — every sound told part of the story. I realized that my job was not just technical. It was emotional. I was capturing atmosphere, not just audio.

## The Art of Listening

Being a sound recordist taught me to listen before I act — something that is surprisingly rare in a fast-paced production environment. I had to train my ears to hear layers of sound: the useful, the beautiful, the distracting, the accidental.

Good audio is not just clean; it is intentional. Sometimes the background noise is the point. Sometimes silence speaks louder than anything. Learning to distinguish those moments was a key creative lesson for me.

## Sound ≠ Afterthought

It is easy to treat sound as something that just happens on the side — especially in student or low-budget productions. But I have learned that if you neglect sound, you risk breaking the emotional thread of your film.

A perfectly composed frame with a bad sound feels cheap. But a rough image with great audio still feels real.

Sound grounds the viewer in space. It can smooth cuts, amplify tension, or completely transform the mood of a scene. It deserves just as much attention and respect as the visuals.

## What I Bring to the Sound Table

Through my experience, I have learned to:
- Adapt quickly in live, uncontrolled environments
- Make creative decisions on the fly under time pressure
- Communicate efficiently with directors and editors about sound needs
- Recognize when sound can carry a moment — even without dialogue

Most importantly, I have learned to respect the emotional power of sound in shaping the viewer's experience.

Whether it is the beat of a bass line or the quiet hum between words, I now see sound as an invisible character in every film — and I am excited to keep exploring what it can do.

    title: 'Behind the Scenes: What Film Production Really Feels Like',

When people hear "film production," they often imagine the shoot itself: cameras rolling, actors performing, someone yelling "action!" and "cut!". But what I have learned from working on multiple sets — in roles from producer to 1st AD to sound — is that the shoot is just the tip of the iceberg.

Film production is everything that happens before, during, and after that magical moment when the camera starts recording. It is equal parts planning, adapting, managing chaos — and somehow still finding space for creativity.

## Pre-Production: The Invisible Work

Most of the real magic happens before anyone steps onto a set. Pre-production is where ideas become tangible:
- Schedules are built
- Locations are secured
- Equipment is arranged
- Teams are formed
- Contingencies are predicted (and then rewritten)

It is also the phase where I have learned to ask the most important questions:
What are we really trying to say with this film?
How do we protect the story while still meeting practical constraints?

Pre-production is where you build the skeleton. If that structure is strong, everything else has a chance to thrive.

## Production: Controlled Chaos

No matter how well you plan, production always finds a way to surprise you. Weather changes. Equipment breaks. Someone is late. Something is louder than it should be.

As a producer or 1st AD, my job has often been to keep the ship steady — to respond quickly, calmly, and with a clear head. And while production days can be long and intense, they are also the most alive. There is a special kind of electricity on a well-run set. Everyone has a job. Everyone has a purpose. And when everything clicks — it is magic.

It is also during production that I have learned the value of kind leadership. No one gives their best work when they are stressed or ignored. I believe film sets work best when built on trust, communication, and a bit of humour.

## Post-Production: The Silent Phase

Once the adrenaline fades and the footage is backed up, post-production begins. It is slower, quieter, but just as crucial. It is where the story finds its rhythm. Where the sound design elevates the image. Where colour adds emotional texture. It is a new kind of magic — and it depends on the strength of everything that came before.

As a producer, I have learned to stay present in post, even when the cameras are gone. Finishing strong matters.

## What Production Has Taught Me

Every project teaches me something new — but here are a few lessons that keep repeating:
- Preparation is power. The more you plan, the more room you leave for creativity.
- Flexibility is survival. Things will change. That is not a failure — it is part of the process.
- People matter most. Great teams make great films.
- No role is too small. Every task on set connects to something bigger.

At the end of the day, film production is not just about making movies. It is about collaboration, leadership, timing, resilience — and love for the craft.

And no matter how chaotic it gets, I keep coming back — because when it all comes together, even for a moment, there is truly nothing else like it.

    title: 'Why I Keep Coming Back to Storytelling',
    date: 'February 1, 2025',

There is something about storytelling that keeps pulling me in — whether I am producing, directing, recording sound, or even standing behind the scenes, watching it all unfold. At first, I thought it was the creativity, then I thought it was the collaboration, then maybe the challenge. But the more I work on sets, the more I realize:

I keep coming back because stories make people feel seen.

## Everyone Just Wants to Be Understood

We all carry experiences, memories, fears, joy — and film has this quiet superpower: it lets us see ourselves in someone else. It allows us to connect across distance, culture, personality, and mood. And whether I am coordinating a shoot as a producer or choosing how a scene is framed as a director, I know I am contributing to something bigger than just logistics.

I am helping shape how a story reaches people — how it lands, how it stays.

## Behind the Camera, But Fully Present

My journey through different roles in production has taught me that the power of storytelling does not lie in just one job title. You do not have to be the writer or lead actor to make something meaningful. The set designer, the floor manager, the person holding the boom mic — we all help carry the story forward.

And what I love most is that each position lets me see the story from a different perspective. Producing taught me structure. Directing taught me vision. Sound taught me to listen. All of it brought me closer to the emotional core of the work.

## The Messy, Beautiful Process

Let us be honest — production can be chaotic. Delays happen. Plans fall through. Sometimes the best scenes are born out of complete improvisation. But that is part of the beauty. There is no single way to tell a story right — there is only being honest, present, and open to change.

The more flexible we are with the process, the stronger the result tends to be. Some of the best creative moments I have been part of were not planned — they were felt.

## Stories Stay

We forget tasks. We forget to-do lists. But we remember how a scene made us feel. We remember a colour, a line, a look, a moment of silence. That is what keeps me in love with this craft.

And that is why I will keep showing up, again and again — not just to make films, but to help shape something that lasts beyond the final frame.
